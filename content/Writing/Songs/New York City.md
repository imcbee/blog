# New York City
**Verse 1**

*G Em*

New York is dusty, paper flies in the wind 

Scaffold is bones, these buildings are headstones

Ghosts are howling, the Hudson just moves along

I'm a passenger, but I don't want to move on 

*C G*

I'm just confused by the views that I hold "What's on the news?"

I'm just a man whose father had to hold my hand

*D C G*

Picking fights are easy when you got anger pent up within 

Hold close to the ones you love these memories don't last when you're so thin

---
**Verse 2**

*G  Em*

It's so cold, thoughts and prayers for the poor 

Apex of man, ants in long corridors 

Lady M said I can have my cake and eat too

But what do I have to offer in this crowded room

*C G*

Anymore, I've lost my will to see myself cause I'm looking at you

Anyway you want cause I just know the place for you

*D C G*

What's your pride when you only have time 

enjoy those around you 

This weather ain't so bad when your wife and your

dad are teasing you too

**Verse 3**

*G  Em*

I'm looking for jazz, the soft heart beat of this land

Soupman is salty, beats eating from a can

Winter in Times Square, the hustle still moves on

What about my art, will someone love me for me

*C G*

Pollock's legacy was to purge for the sake of art

Savor what you can and thank God for the man you've become

*D C G*

What's your life when you're thin as dust that blows into the wind  (Slow down) 

I'm a man who's surrounded by the love no tomb can decay
