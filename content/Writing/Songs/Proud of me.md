# Proud of me
**Verse 1**
*A C#m E*
Someone said we're wasting what's left
And I'm just itching to find my rest 
Arguments stopped being back and forth
What does it mean to stand and feel your worth? 

**Verse 2**
*A C#m E*
Empty how you do's and hallelujahs
From an ivory tower, you can't the hear screams
Chuck a couple rolls, you don't really care do ya
What does it mean to be proud and dream? 

**Chorus**
*A (B) C#m A (B) E*
I'm not proud of me
But I don't regret the way
And the man who I'm trying to be
Cause I've got only you(those) to love and care

**Verse 3**
*A C#m E*
Chemicals and fire are knocking on the door 
Melt the gold and silver from the poor
Where are those in the great divide
What does it mean to be humble n' alive? 

**Chorus 2**
*A (B) C#m A (B) E*
I'm not proud of me
But I don't regret the way
And The man who I'm trying to be
Cause I've got only you(those) to love and care

Who you say we are?
And who do you think we can be?
Can I be proud of here and now?
Don't hide the love that's hardly found
