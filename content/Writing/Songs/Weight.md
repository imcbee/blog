# Weight
**Verse 1**

*Csus2 G*

See how heavy the weight falls

Reap the dry crops you owe

Death speaks where no light is shown

Mute are the cries in this land

---
**Pre-Chorus**

*Em D/F# G CM7*

Come and be in "welcomed" and "free" 

An empty crowd that's only forced to be

---
**Chorus**

*Em C D*

The tables and hands fold to save face another day

Hours with fires circle around with gaslight starry-eyes

Foundations fray and cliques raid in masked charades 

I came apart. I came apart. 

---
**Verse 2**

*Csus2 G*

Taste the bitterness of control

Woe the wisdom of the blind 

The blood doesn't flow from deed

Creed is greater than my family

---
**Pre-Chorus**

*Em D/F# G CM7*

Come and be in "welcomed" and "free" 

An empty crowd that's only forced to be

---
**Outro Verse**

*Csus2 G*

Feel the chains break away 

Redeem time spent on lies 

Life finally begins in the end

Speak truth so close to heart
