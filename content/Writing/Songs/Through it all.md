# Through it all
**Verse 1**
*G#m C#m*
I've been with you watching, all the strength you are clawing
Don't - - say - - this is not enough
All the tears we're losing can't escape what your fighting
Don't - - say - - we're giving up

**Chorus**
*F# E*
And we are fighting through it all
And you are gonna see this through it all

*B.  G#m. C#m E*
When I first fell in love, I was torn in two
But when I set my eyes, I was brought through every single fire with burns to heal

*F# E*
And we are fighting through it all
And you are gonna see this through it all

**Verse 2**
*G#m C#m*
I know you've been watching, all these things are haunting
Don't - - stay - - please stay here with me
Tally flaws  I'm scratching, please save me from my own thinking
Can - - you - - save me once again?

**Chorus Outro**
*F# E*
And we are fighting through it all
And you are gonna see this through it all

*B G#m C#m E*
When I first fell in love, I was torn in two
But when I set my eyes, I was brought through every single fire with burns to heal
