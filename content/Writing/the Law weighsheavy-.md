# the Law weighsheavy-
	the Law weighsheavy-

tied to an anvil,hammering the ocean bed like a gavel.

though honey is glossed onto my lips as I fed on each phrase.

as these words read:beautiful and dread,

trending neck deep,it twists myside bitterly

I planned a lifeliving to “self-righteous” Myself from these standards.

to find,wasted beneath a grave of lies.

pure is the Word;as I place my left,gently on His face.

But right is never raised,for the Truth is doubt in sight.

The sounds of major and minor fight within me

\--to rule the home of my heart.

            He then takes the heavy book,

from the hands that cried for a sliver of hope.

these demands satisfied, with a weakwhisper of request.

white and black reverse;justice consume the Host

behold the brilliant light! in which i've held in the dark.
