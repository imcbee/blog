# CCC

*F C G*
What was the time? Mom, I don't know and don't wanna talk. 
What was he thinking about? It's all his own fault. 
What's he wishing for? Just a way out. 

*Interlude: Am G*

*Am F G*
Run back, try hard quips; awkward attempts. 
Teased flaws, baby blue pants don't work with that. 
Spiritual crippleness, where are my friends? 

---
*F C G*
Where's that confidence? You should of earned it by now. 
I've been here 4 years now, you've got in somehow. 
I locked my keys in my car. I saw ya drove I didn't want you to go.

*Interlude: Am G*

*Am F G*
Ya made me,  pack up that pick up truck
Cigars, campfire hymns, measurin' dicks 
Flat bed, barely fit all my stuff

---
*Am F C G*
What am I suppose to do? 
How am I suppose to feel? 
Who am I suppose to trust now? 

Where am I suppose to go? 
When am I going to change? 
Why do these voices shout (so loud)?

*Outro: F C G 2x*
