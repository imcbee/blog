# Secondments
*Turn: C Dm Am F*

**Verse 1:**
*F C* 
So it comes to this? Your leading me out with a
*F C G F*
Carrot on a stick and sign my life with 5yrs of regret
*Am F*
And I just wanted to be good to you
And I just thought that helped this through

**Chorus :**
*F C G*
I don't wanna see myself back into that corner
I don't wanna drop my fists in nice demeanor
*F C G F*
I can see myself scared in that body armor
*C Em F*
Trying again, secondments, breach through the water
Crying friend,  hold my hand, grief won't bring you farther

**Verse 2**
*F C*
When I become old of enough to doubt myself
*F C G F*
in so many ways. Can I see the grace you have for me
*Am F*
And I just want to useful in life
*Am F G hold*
And I just wished I gave this a real try

**Verse 3**
*F C*
So I'll just fold, can't keep a straight face
*F C G F*
And I'll just lose, can't save face just to lose my faith
*Am F*
And I just want to be close to you
And I just wished I was stronger for you
