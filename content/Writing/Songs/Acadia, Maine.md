# Acadia, Maine
**Verse 1**
*C G*
Walk with me further pass 
Every pace the coastline disappears
I've heard it from word of mouth
The passage to Bar Island fades at dusk 

Precipice and Cadillac 
Strive and strain, the marriage brings us dawn
Reaching peninsulas
Wind lifts every strand of broken hair

---
**Chorus**
*Em D/F# G C2*
Can you stand with the mountain beneath your feet?
Does bed sounds better to sleep?
Do you awake with earl grey tea? 

---
**Verse 2**
*C G*
Coffee stains in Portland, Maine 
Can't afford expensive outdoor clothes
Careful words are always hard
Italian dinner is an awkward start

Crippled ships and Fezziwigs
Café conversations seeps this heart
Sculpture garden cobble stone 
The moon sets and our life begins

Can you stand with the mountain beneath your feet?
Does bed sounds better to sleep?
Do you awake with earl grey tea?

**Bridge Outro**
*Em - - C/G D*
And after a year, it feels unreal
That you would you love me 
Many of songs, that we'd had sung
Slowly untangled the knots in soul
We've danced in that small little kitchen 
And not for a second I'd lost that vision
You and I seeking The Most High
With songs of praises
