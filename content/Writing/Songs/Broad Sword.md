# Broad Sword
**Verus 1**
*Fsus C (end Am G F)*
Where is your breath, my lungs are punctured
Beautiful broadsword, broken by quenching

*Fsus C*
Mhmmm mhmmm

Water raging, where's your still for me.
Furnace fire, dross burns away

*Instrumental: Am C D/F# F*

---
**Verus 2**
*Fsus C (end Am G F)*
Here comes the rain, hear my prayer
Shoulder to stand on, are you still near?

*Fsus C*
Mhmmm mhmmm

Count your blessings, I'm short of change
Beggar speaks softly, what's left for me?

---
**Chorus**
*Am C D/F# F*
Oh in the quiet, I whispered, you heard
How gently grasp, my heart, at last you moved
Dance with me, in the fire, I want to breath

---
**Verus 3**
*Fsus C (end Am G F)*
Sharpen my iron, love pierce my heart
Fountain never ceasing, wash me clean

*Fsus C*
Mhmmm mhmmm

What's got you worried, grace is a full tang
Calm this raging sea, dwell over me
