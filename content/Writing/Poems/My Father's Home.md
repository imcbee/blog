# My Father's Home
There is pain in the home upstairs
It echoes, it blares
During nights, we clench our ears
Pretending we do not hear
These people, we do not care

Raise the volume, not to hear disputing mother
Change the scene, can not bear crying daughter
Or let's have a listen?!, disrespect, sex and infidelity
Make these concrete walls fatherless and cruddy

The anger and bitterness crescendo
As our interests begins to plateau
Silently, a child's light fades low
Hold fast to the confession of hope
There is promise in my Father's home

Many rooms does my Father's home holds
A dinner feast awaits generations foretold
These walls won't ring deafing shame or bitter remarks
A new family yearns for joy to spark

Oh, there is peace to arrive in my Father's home
Lay down your burdens, to be accepted for who you are
