# Hallowed Ground
**Verse 1**
*F C Dm Fsus*
Wake, to know some time just sleeps
And my head, wants to fall through the glass
Dose that scares my heart to beat
And my sickle, isn't sharp to reap

*G Am Fsus*
And I'm confined, foes of my shame

---
**Chorus**
*Csus2/G Amadd9 Fsus*
Hold it off, I want to know
How you feel? 

---
**Verse 2**
*F C Dm Fsus*
Doubts, drown deep into your mind
Does this job, liberate your lack?
Boast, the ephemera of our time
And my hands, still digs for peat

*G Am Fsus*
And I am contrite, for what have I gain

---
**Chorus Outro**
*Csus2/G Amadd9 Fsus*
Hold it off, I want to know
How you feel? 
Where you are, who you trust? 
Come and hear

*Csus2/G Amadd9 Fsus*
Who you are, close enough
Cherish sight
Read these lips, whisper hiss
Everything's alright

*Csus2/G Amadd9 Fsus*
Hallowed ground, stand amazed
Eyes deceive?
Blessed the loss, take from me
Help me speak
