# The Vow
Life holds uncertainty and trials that we never see coming. 
Life shows us so many challenges that must face when we are not ready. 
Life can make us doubt ourselves and test our faith. 

But life can bring us joy when there is direction. 
Life gives us opportunities to find happiness, even in the midst of hardship. 
Life is worth it when our hope is not in ourselves, but in Christ. 

I ask myself, "What is it that I want in marriage?

I want to make music with you that brings joy and hope to others. 
I want to build a home that our family and friends can feel loved in.
 I want to be apart of opportunities unfolding before us and share experience with joy. 
I want to be apart of your life, Denise.

From the time I have gotten to know you, I knew God loves you and has never left you. 
You remind me that I am loved by Jesus, and you bring the best out of me. 
You make me want to be a better person and show me hope. 

*I love you Denise Swanberg...*

My vow is to protect you and our relationship and always point you towards Christ, our Savior. 
I vow to persist and fight through conflict and strife with you. 
I vow to grow in wisdom and understanding together with you, hand in hand.
I vow to love you 

*I am yours, no matter what...*
