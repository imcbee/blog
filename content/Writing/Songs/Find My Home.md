# Find My Home
**Verse 1**

*F C G Am*

Crossing from sea to sea, expectations fell on me

*F C G*

Trying to make my own waves by jumping in
Got my college degree, it wasn't what I hoped to be
And the water is so cold that I froze
Little diaspora, may you bloom with flora
Cut my teeth in lecture notes and Fool's gold

*Fsus2 Csus2 Fsus2 C*

Oh mother, I wander 
Oh mother, I wander 

---
**Chorus**

*F C Am G*

Give me a map and I won't go so far
I just find my way back to the start 
These roads aren't that very long
If you been there once then you've seen them all
And I'll find my home
I'll find my home

---
**Verse 2**

*F C G Am*

She was from a distant land, I could never understand

*F C G*

Though it was her love that raised me right
Every moment was sweet, now I see the harvest she reaped
Oh the winds labored to get her there
When she finally set sail, home was lost to no avail 
Every spoonful bite is family rite

*Fsus2 Csus2 Fsus2 C*

Oh mother, your not far now
Oh mother, your not far now

---
**Bridge**

*G Am F C*

So please don't go so far, where the riptide tears us apart
I'll sing Amazing Grace, to sooth you in the darkest place
There'll be rivers to cross, but trouble never gets you lost
Oh I am sufficiently calm, onto this promise, dear, hold on, hold on, hold on
