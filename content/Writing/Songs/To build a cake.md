# To build a cake
**Verse 1**

*Em D G*

I'll bring flour and plan the recipe

Bring the sugar that's so sweet

*Em D Csus2 D*

We'll make it a day to replay in our minds

Without anyone that can make a say

---
**Verse 2**

It's my birthday and you are special to me

Every tired thought you're all I see

With allure to make a scheme

Come make it special, special for me

---
**Chorus**

*Csus2 Em G D*

And so I slip away

Into an hour glass

And fantasy floods every waking beat

---
**Verse 3**

I'll take slice of you any day

With the real part of you, miles away

All I'm thinking it's my birthday today

til we built this cake, come make my day

---
**Chorus**

And so I slip away

Into an hour glass

And fantasy floods every waking beat

And so let's pretend

It's not even happening

And it becomes a smashed disarray

---
**Outro**
Come make it special, special for me

Let's build this cake, come make my day
